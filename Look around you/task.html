<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>In this step, you need to calculate how many mines are around each empty cell. You need to check 8 cells if the cell is in the middle, 5 cells if the cell is in the side, and 3 cells if the cell is in the corner. If there are from 1 to 8 mines are around the cell, you need to output the number of mines instead of the symbol representing an empty cell.</p>

<p>Check all the possibilities carefully. </p>
