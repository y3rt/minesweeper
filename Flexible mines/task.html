<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>It is not interesting when the field has exactly the same setup every time and you know where all the mines are located, isn't it? To avoid that, let's generate a new random configuration every time the user wants to play the game.</p>

<p>Let's improve the program and let the user choose how many mines she wants to play with on the field. The user just needs to input a number from the keyboard.</p>

<p>The program should ask the user how many mines he wants to see on the field and then display the field with mines. The mines must still be visible to the user, you will hide them in the following stages. Make sure that mines are marked with the <code class="java">'X'</code> character and safe fields are marked with the <code class="java">'.'</code> character. Also, use a 9x9 field, the tests check the field of this size.</p>

<p>In this stage, you need to use a random number generator. The class you need is <code class="java">java.util.Random</code>.</p>
