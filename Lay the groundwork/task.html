<p>Minesweeper is a game with a field in which there are a lot of mines. You need to find where all these mines are located. To help you find the mines, there are cells which show how many mines are located around them.</p>

<p>Your first step would be easy. In this step, you need to output some state of the field. The field contains mines marked as <code class="java">'X'</code> and safe places marked as <code class="java">'.'</code>, but you can choose your own symbols for marking places with mines and safe places. Note that all the mines are in plain sight, so you don't have to hide them from the user at this stage!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>In the example, there are 10 mines in a 9x9 field. You can write to the output of any other configuration of mines.</p>
